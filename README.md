# KaggleHousePricePredictionModel by Shakeeb Arsalan Zacky, February 17th 2022 - March 14th 2022

This is an algorithm for the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
I used Kaggle's "Intro to Machine Learning" course as a core supplemented by various online resources to teach myself
the basics of machine learning and data analysis as well as apply them in an easy to see and evaluate manner.
