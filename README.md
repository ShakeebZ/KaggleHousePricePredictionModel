#House Price Prediction Model - Kaggle Competition

This is an algorithm written in python on a jupyter notebook for the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).


I used Kaggle's "Intro to Machine Learning" course as a base and supplemented it with various online resources to teach myself
the basics of machine learning and data analysis as well as apply them in an easy to see and evaluate manner. This project required the use of the pandas and numpy libraries and explored the uses of decision trees and random forest models.
